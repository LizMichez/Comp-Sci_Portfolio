 			<h4> Assignment 1 - Peer Editing</h4>
 			2018-09-24 <br>
 			This Website was reviewed by Owen, Areeb, and Timmy, who made remarks regarding what they liked and what they thought should be improved about the website. Below each potential improvment/issue is what I have to do to either solve it, or a reason why I have not changed it yet. <br>
 			<br>
 			Owen:
 			<ul>
 				<li>The header, background and navigation bar all look very nice. I really like the three circular buttons from the home page especially the shadow effect when I hover over it. Also, I noticed the favicon on the tab bar which very creative (even though I did it first).Moreover, all links on the navigation bar are functional.</li>
 				<ul> <li>Thank you!</li></ul> <br>

 				<li> You have a ton of spelling errors</li>
 				<ul> <li>I will have all the text in a doccument so I can edit thigns like spelling and grammer, but for now I am more focused on formatting</li> </ul> <br>

 				<li>Finally, you’re “About Me” page could use some more detail</li>
 				<ul> <li>That's because at this time it is not formatted, That issue should be resolved within one to two days of this peer editing assignment</li> </ul> <br> 
 			</ul>
 			Areeb:
 			<ul>
 				<li> </li>
 			</ul>
 			Timmy:
 			<ul>
 				<li>At the home page, under the “Want More Cool Stuff?” section, the pictures go over the white box border and on to the side of the website. Make the images smaller. </li>
 				<ul> <li>This issue has now been fixed by putting the images in the same class as the upper three images</li></ul> <br>

				<li>At the home page, space the letters out for the descriptions of the buttons.</li>
				<ul> <li>The space between the letters has now been increaced, and I will be using a softer colour which should make the headers mroe appealing</li> </ul> <br>

				<li>There is grammatical and punctuation errors in the description of the website.</li>
				<ul> <li>I will have all the text in a doccument so I can edit thigns like spelling and grammer, but for now I am more focused on formatting</li> </ul> <br>

				<li>In the assignments page, the text is aligned to the right. And also random 1 at the top left of the white box. Also lots of grammatical errors when describing the assignment. </li>
				<ul> <li>Gramatical issues have been covered, and the 1. is a placholder for an image I will be adding to that section so it will be removed shortly</li> </ul> <br> 

				<li>The about me page looks rushed. Not much detail. </li>
				<ul> <li>That's because at this time it is not formatted, That issue should be resolved within one to two days of this peer editing assignment</li> </ul> <br> 

				<li>In the independent project page, you probably shouldn’t say “bois”.</li>
				<ul> <li>Yeah that's a place holder</li> </ul> <br>
